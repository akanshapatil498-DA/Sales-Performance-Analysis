🛍️ Retail Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis
📌 Business Problem

A retail company wanted to evaluate its overall sales performance and profitability across different regions, customer segments, product categories, and shipping modes.

Despite having large volumes of transactional data, the company lacked a consolidated view to understand:

Which regions and segments generate the highest profit?

How discounts impact profitability?
